React Movie Critic Review Project


Overview: 

For this scenario, you have been asked to write an application which will provide information about movie critic reviews. Approach this problem as if the application will go to production. We don't expect it to be perfect (no production code is) but it should also not be a hacked together script. Spend whatever time you think is reasonable but no more than 20 hours. Do the best that you can, with the time you have available.

While the end result may not be your best work, it should represent you and your abilities as a developer.

You can use whatever 3rd party libraries you feel are appropriate but the framework used must be React and attempt to follow React best practices. We've got things started for you with a boilerplate and some examples.

Note: Please use functional components (instead of class components).
